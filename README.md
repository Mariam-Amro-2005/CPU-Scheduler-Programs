# CPU Schedulers Simulator

## Overview
This project is a CPU Scheduler Simulator written in Java. It demonstrates various CPU scheduling algorithms, including:

1. **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**
2. **Non-Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
4. **FCAI Scheduling** (a custom adaptive scheduling algorithm)

The simulator provides insights into scheduling performance by calculating metrics like waiting time, turnaround time, and quantum updates for FCAI Scheduling.

## Features
- **Simulated Scheduling Algorithms**: Implements multiple standard and custom scheduling techniques.
- **Performance Metrics**: Outputs average waiting and turnaround times.
- **Dynamic Quantum Management**: Unique quantum handling for the FCAI Scheduler.
- **Graphical Representation**: Bonus feature to visualize scheduling order using a Gantt chart.
